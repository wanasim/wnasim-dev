              lorem ip sum I spent the next few summers
              indoors working on a rocket design, while I
              recovered from the multiple surgeries it took
              to fix my badly broken legs. It took nine
              iterations, but when I was 15 I sent my dadâ€™s
              Blackberry into orbit and was able to transmit
              a photo back down to our family computer from
              space.
